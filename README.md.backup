# About
This is a custom firmware for the BTT TF Cloud V1.0 (https://github.com/bigtreetech/BTT-SD-TF-Cloud-V1.0) devices.

**Changes from the original BTT TF Cloud V1.0 firmware**

* Fixed SSID and password
* SD card is used only when a connection via WebDAV is established

This repository is based on the work of ardyesp (https://github.com/ardyesp/ESPWebDAV). Thanks! 


# Building
PlatformIO (https://platformio.org/) is recommended but also the classic Arduino IDE should work. You need to install the [Arduino esp8266 libraries](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino). PlatformIO should install it automatically.

## How to
1. Open PlatformIO

2. Open the folder with this repository

3. Adapt `WiFiSettings.h`to your WiFi settings

4. Build it

5. Connect your PC to the device  
**WARNING: Don't insert the BTT device the same time in a SD slot because of back feeding the voltage or remove the LM1117 voltage regulator (see below)!**

6. Upload it to the device
7. When PlatformIO (esptool) is trying to connect to the BTT device press and hold the BOOT switch and hit the RESET switch a shot of time.

```
Uploading .pio/build/esp12e/firmware.bin
esptool.py v2.8
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0
Connecting........_____..
```

8. Wait until the flash process is done

9. Reset the device again with the RESET switch.

# Technical Stuff

## WebDAV Server 
This project is a WiFi WebDAV server using ESP8266 SoC. It maintains the filesystem on an SD card.

Supports the basic WebDav operations - *PROPFIND*, *GET*, *PUT*, *DELETE*, *MKCOL*, *MOVE* etc.

Once the WebDAV server is running on the ESP8266, a WebDAV client like Windows can access the filesystem on the SD card just like a cloud drive. The drive can also be mounted like a networked drive, and allows copying/pasting/deleting files on SD card remotely.


## Pinout

BTT TF Cloud hardware uses the following SD card connections:

ESP Module|SD Card
---|---
GPIO13|MOSI   
GPIO12|MISO   
GPIO14|SCK    
GPIO4|CS   
GPIO5|CS Sense

Here is a sample schematic which is similar to the BTT TF Cloud devices. The real BTT TF Cloud schematic is not fully documented and may different form the following schematic.

The card should be formatted for Fat16 or Fat32

To access the drive from Windows, type ```\\esp_hostname_or_ip\DavWWWRoot``` at the Run prompt, or use Map Network Drive menu in Windows Explorer.


## Developing
When removing the LM1117 voltage regulator it is possible to connect to the ESP8266 to USB and let the device connected via SD.
